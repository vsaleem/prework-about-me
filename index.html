      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a human who is ready to learn!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Mansfield, Louisiana.... not New Orleans!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love learning new things, trying new resturants, and walking my dog, Annalise.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My goal is to be in a position where I can help improve communication technology for non-profits, and maybe the around the globe!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Baltimore, Md, as of January 10, 2020.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a Web Developer because I want to connect with and help under-served communities. 
        In my previous position, I worked with children and families within my community for over 3 years. 
        During that time, I noticed that a lot of issues that occurred were due to lack of accesibility and communication. 
        I believe that Web Development is a reliable key to solving communication issues, if created properly with the clients' needs in mind.
        I mean...Everyone has a cell phone, right?! I plan to create web enivornments that are easily accessible, full of feng shei, and helpful to everyone.</p>
